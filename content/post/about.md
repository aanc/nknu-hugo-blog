Hello ! This is my "about/contact" page. I didn't got the time to write it yet, but i'll do it asap !

##### Quick facts:
* The theme is based on the [Ghost Theming Tutorial](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/building-a-ghost-theme-from-scratch--webdesign-16179) written by Kezz Bracey on [Tutsplus](https://tutsplus.com), and the source files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nwknu/nknu-ghost-theme).
* Various background images are from from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/)


Cheers
