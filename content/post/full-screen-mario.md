5mn to kill ? Try [Full Screen Mario](http://www.fullscreenmario.com/) ! This is a JS/HTML5 remake of Super Mario Bros, developed by [Josh Goldberg](http://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/).

You can play the levels of the original game, but you can also play custom levels made by the built in level editor available for the game. And if you want to go deeper and check what's under the hood, the code is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario).

Have fun !
